# Mint

Mint is a web app that enables trainees with mild intellectual disability to learn work skills independently.

We directly worked with the organisation [Association For Persons with Special Needs](https://www.apsn.org.sg/) to create a web app to help their trainees and trainers at their [APSN Café for All](https://www.facebook.com/apsncafeforall/).

Trainees at the café face issues memorising food recipes. Mint is available to be used by trainees and instructors on any device. Mint displays step-by-step recipe instructions, with supporting images and a function for trainees to listen to instructions aloud. The user interface is designed with ease of use and intuitiveness in mind. We listened to what trainees and instructors need in Mint and designed it to be accessible and useful for them.

This project spanned July 2021 to Jan 2022.

This project was coded by [@cervonwong](https://github.com/cervonwong) and [@BenTan101](https://github.com/BenTan101).

This project is complete. We created this working prototype which allows basic CRUD of recipes with a complete UI. We presented the project at the Tech for Good festival in the finals.
