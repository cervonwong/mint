object RandomRecipeController {
    Controller should not depend on UI, instead UI decides\nwhen to request, and how to react to data, controller\ndoesn't explicitly tell them to do it.
}
object RandomRecipeButton
object RecipeLabel
object Recipe {
    Model should not know anything\nabout the existence of controllers or UI.
}

RandomRecipeController <.. RandomRecipeButton : < depends on controller to request changes
RandomRecipeController <.. RecipeLabel : < depends on controller to react to changes
Recipe <.. RandomRecipeController : < depends on model to send data
Recipe <.. RecipeLabel : < depends on model to receive data

note as n
    If you import something,
    then you depend on it.
    The converse is also true.
