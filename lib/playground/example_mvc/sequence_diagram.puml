title Sequence of what happens internally between UI and Controller in Example MVC.

actor User
participant "RandomRecipeButton" as button
participant "RecipeLabel" as label
participant "RandomRecipeController" as controller

User -> button: Bonks button\n<i>"I want a random recipe please"
button -> controller : <i>requestRandomRecipe()</i>\nRequest to generate random recipe

note over controller: In an actual app, there will be more logic\nhere, such as database read/write.

controller -> label  : <i>notifyListeners()</i>\nNotify all listeners something changed

note over label: Many widgets can be notified by\ncontroller. In this example, only\nRecipeLabel needs to do something\nabout the change.

label -> controller  : Calls <i>randomRecipe</i> getter\n(Consumer's builder handles this)
controller --> label : <i>randomRecipe</i> is returned
label --> User       : Displays to user new random recipe :)
